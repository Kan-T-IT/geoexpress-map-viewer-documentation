# Search Bar

The Geoexpress viewer includes a search bar similar to those of Google Maps and Bing Maps, which is used to find exact locations on the map. To use it, type the name of the location into the search bar in the upper-right corner and press Enter. A list of options will appear, and selecting one will zoom the map to the chosen location.

## Direct Access to GeoNode

The viewer allows direct access to the [GeoNode of Geoexpress by Kan](https://geoexpress-demo.kan.com.ar) via the Kan logo located in the bottom-left corner of the viewer. Clicking on the logo will redirect the user to the GeoNode.

If we have sufficient permissions, we can upload new layers; otherwise, we can view them.
