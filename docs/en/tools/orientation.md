# Orientation Tools

## Orientation

At times, the map will not have the north pointing upwards, as is conventionally seen on maps, and the cardinal points will be rotated. To help the user orient themselves at all times, the viewer has a compass icon that serves this function. Like any compass, its red needle always points north, no matter how rotated the map is.

To return the map to the north-up position, simply click on the icon.

## 3D/2D View

The Geoexpress viewer offers the advantage of being able to display layers in both 3D and 2D.

To optimize the visualization of each type of layer, the viewer includes both a 3D and a 2D view, with the latter being the default top-down map view. Among the navigation tools, the 3D view icon, when clicked, activates this view, tilting the map to allow a better appreciation of the relief in 3D layers, whether it be a vector layer, a 3D object, a DEM, or a mesh. 

To return to the 2D view from 3D, simply click the same icon again.
