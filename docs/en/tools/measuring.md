# Tools for the Viewer

The Geoexpress Viewer includes tools to measure distances and areas on the map. Click on the wrench-shaped icon to open a submenu with five icons.

## Distance Measurement

The first icon is used to measure distances. To start a measurement, click on the icon and then on the point of the map where the measurement will begin. Moving the mouse from that point will draw a dashed line to the next point. Once the cursor reaches the endpoint, click again. You can finish the measurement by double-clicking, or you can draw another line to continue measuring; however, this will count as a new measurement, and its length will not be added to the previous one. If you perform multiple measurements simultaneously, finish each one the same way, by double-clicking on the endpoint.

Once the measurement between points is complete, intermediate points will appear. Clicking and holding the mouse on these points allows you to move them to perform new partial measurements. Adjusting the original points also allows you to modify their position using the zoom.

## Area Measurement

The second icon is used to measure areas. Click on the icon and then on one of the vertices of the area. Continue clicking on each vertex to define the area’s outline. Once you reach the last vertex, double-click to complete the measurement, and the surface area will be displayed in km². 

As with distance measurements, after marking the area, you can edit it by moving the nodes you’ve created or adding new ones at intermediate points.

To remove measurements from the map, click on the eraser icon.

## Presentation Mode

The viewer includes a presentation mode. The user needs to click on the second-to-last icon in the toolbar. This mode allows for continuous camera rotation around the map’s center, hiding all buttons and toolbars to display only the map image. To exit presentation mode, click anywhere on the screen. 

## Printing

The last icon allows the user to generate a printable file from the map image. Clicking the button opens a menu where parameters such as page size, orientation, format, and DPI can be configured. 

A preview of the print area will appear, highlighted on the map. The grayer areas will not be printed. 

After configuring everything, click **Generate**, and the file will download. To exit the print function, click the **x** on the right side of the menu header.
