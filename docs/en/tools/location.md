The zoom level is displayed in the viewer's URL, after the language code and the **#**. For example, in the URL [https://geoexpress.kan.com.ar/es#17.56/-34.608646/-58.372966](https://geoexpress.kan.com.ar/es#17.56/-34.608646/-58.372966), the zoom level is 17.56. The maximum zoom is 22, and the minimum is 0.9.
