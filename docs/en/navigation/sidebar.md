# Sidebar

On the left side of the screen, there is a vertical sidebar that allows navigation between categories and subcategories to enable or disable layers predefined by the client from the **Layers Manager** and to display or hide them.

Each icon represents a different **category** of layers, grouped by a particular theme. When clicking on a category, the sidebar will expand to the right, opening the **layer panel**, where **subcategories** can be viewed. These group the layers within the categories into more specific themes or sub-themes.

Clicking on a subcategory will finally reveal the **layers**.

By clicking on each layer, it will be activated and visible on the map. Doing so will also open a **layer card** to the right of the layer panel. It may be necessary to click on the greater-than symbol to the left of the cross to expand it.

At the bottom of the sidebar, there is a gear-shaped icon.

Clicking on it allows access to a link for a brief guide to the screen options.
