# Layer Card

The layer card allows the user to perform various operations related to the layer.

## Opacity

In GeoExpress, the opacity of all layers is set to 50% by default, unless a specific opacity has been previously assigned. Some layers, such as meshes, DEMs, and 3D objects, have fixed opacity and cannot be modified.

## Zoom to Layer

The **Zoom to Layer** icon adjusts the map view to the extent of the currently active layer.

## Filters

The **Filters** button allows filtering the data within the layer. For example, the Localities layer is organized by provinces, and through the filter, we can select some, all, or none. 

!!! warning

    RESTRICTION: If the limit of 30 options is exceeded, the selection filter will not appear on the layer card.

## BIM Icon

The BIM icon is available only for 3D object layers with loaded .ifc files.

Clicking on the icon allows the analysis of the 3D object and the activation or deactivation of its elements. To return to the map, click on the arrow in the upper-left corner.

## Layer Management

### Layer Overlap

If multiple layers are activated, the order is determined by the activation sequence, with the last activated layer overlapping the others.

This order can be modified by dragging the layer cards in the list. This also changes the layer overlap order on the map.

### Disabling Layers

To deactivate a layer, you can uncheck it in the layer panel or close the layer card. 

![](../images/cards14.png)

The black bar with the label "Active Layers" allows you to deactivate all active layers using the trash can button.

The active layers bar also has an upward arrow that, when clicked, hides the layer cards. Once hidden, clicking on the same arrow, now pointing downward, will show the cards again.

To maximize the map area on the screen, you can close the layer panel by clicking on the cross in the upper-right corner. To reopen the panel, click on any category.
